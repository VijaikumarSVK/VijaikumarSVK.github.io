bio: Hi, I'm Vijai Kumar. I'm a data analyst with a passion for using data to make a real impact, especially in the healthcare industry. I've got over a year and a half of experience working with complex healthcare datasets, using tools like Python, SAS, and Power BI to turn those numbers into actionable insights.s
I'm always looking for ways to automate things and make our work more efficient. I even used machine learning(NLP) to build a system that helps farmers get quick and accurate answers to their questions, which was pretty cool!
I'm a quick learner, I'm always looking to expand my skills, and I'm really excited about the potential of data to improve things. I'm hoping to find a challenging role where I can use my skills to solve real-world problems and make a difference..
