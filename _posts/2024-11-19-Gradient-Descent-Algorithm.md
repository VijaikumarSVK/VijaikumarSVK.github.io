**Executive Summary:** This project aims to classify handwritten digits (0-9) using machine learning techniques, primarily focusing on the MNIST(Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) dataset. The project explores various classification algorithms, evaluates their performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, and implements techniques like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance. It also delves into more advanced concepts such as multilabel and multioutput classification.

The complete Python code and required file for this analysis is available on my <b><a href="https://github.com/VijaikumarSVK/Gradient-Descent-Machine-Learning-Optimization-Algorithm">GitHub</a></b>
